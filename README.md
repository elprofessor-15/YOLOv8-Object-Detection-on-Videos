# YOLOv8-Object-Detection-on-Videos

This repository demonstrates the use of the YOLOv8 model for real-time object detection on videos. Key features include:

	•	Implementation of the pre-trained YOLOv8 model to detect and annotate objects in video frames.
	•	Processing of input video files, applying object detection to each frame, and saving the output with bounding boxes and class labels.
	•	The flexibility to apply the model on custom videos of your choice.
	•	A step-by-step guide for setting up and running the model on any video input.

This project showcases the powerful capabilities of YOLOv8 for efficient and accurate object detection in dynamic visual data.

The colab notebook is attactched which includes the implemented.

The sample input and tehir output videos are also attatched to see how well the model performed
